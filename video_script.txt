CLAWCOMPUTE DEMO SCRIPT (3-4 Minutes)

Target Audience: Hackathon Judges & Developers
Goal: Show, don't just tell. Prove it works live on-chain.

----------------------------------------------------------------

0:00 — THE HOOK (15s)

VISUAL:
- Start with a blank black screen or simple title card: "The $20 Problem".
- Cut to: Screenshot of a monthly subscription invoice (like ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro).

AUDIO:
"You're paying $20 a month for AI subscriptions. But today, your agent only needs 11 seconds of compute."
"That wasted capital is the problem. ClawCompute is the solution."

VISUAL:
- Hard cut to: ClawCompute Dashboard loading up (animated entry).

----------------------------------------------------------------

0:15 — ACT 1: THE MARKETPLACE (30s)

VISUAL:
- ClawCompute Dashboard (Full Screen).
- Mouse hovers over the "Live" indicator on a provider card.
- Zoom in on: "Price: 0.0001 tBNB/s".

AUDIO:
"Welcome to ClawCompute — the first decentralized marketplace for autonomous AI compute on BNB Chain."
"Every provider you see here is a real node, registered on-chain. They aren't selling subscriptions. They're selling time."
"I can pick any model — Llama 3, Mixtral — and pay only for the seconds I use."

----------------------------------------------------------------

0:45 — ACT 2: OPENING THE STREAM (45s)

VISUAL:
- Click "Chat" on a provider.
- Type prompt: "Explain the utility of BNB Chain in 50 words."
- Click Send.
- IMPORTANT: Show the MetaMask popup clearly. Mouse over the "Confirm" button.

AUDIO:
"Watch closely. I'm not sending a flat fee. I'm opening a payment stream via the StreamPay smart contract."
"Money starts flowing the moment the stream opens. It's permissionless. Trustless. And live on BSC Testnet."

VISUAL:
- Show "Creating payment stream..." loading state.
- Transaction confirms -> Toast notification: "Stream #42 Created".

----------------------------------------------------------------

1:30 — ACT 3: THE MAGIC MOMENT (45s)

VISUAL:
- Split Screen (if possible) or fast switch:
  - Left: Frontend showing "Sending inference request..."
  - Right: BSCScan showing the createStream transaction you just made.

AUDIO:
"The provider agent — running autonomously on a Render node — detects the on-chain stream."
"It verifies the funds are flowing, fires up the Llama 3 model via Groq, and generates the response."

VISUAL:
- Markdown response streams in on the frontend (highlight the rich formatting!).
- Pause for effect while text generates.

----------------------------------------------------------------

2:15 — ACT 4: SETTLEMENT & REFUND (30s)

VISUAL:
- Response finishes.
- Toast notification: "Stream Cancelled. Refund processed."
- Click the Tx Link ("Cancel") to open BSCScan.
- Highlight the Internal Txns or "Tokens Transferred" tab showing the refund.

AUDIO:
"Response delivered. Stream cancelled immediately."
"Here's the beautiful part. I locked 60 seconds of funds. The inference took 4.2 seconds."
"The contract paid the provider exactly for 4.2 seconds, and instantly refunded me the rest. Zero waste."

----------------------------------------------------------------

2:45 — ACT 5: UNDER THE HOOD (30s)

VISUAL:
- Switch to Terminal (dark mode). show `npx tsx agent/provider-agent.ts` logs scrolling.
- Highlight a log line: "Withdrawing 0.00042 BNB from stream #42".

AUDIO:
"This isn't a mockup. There is a real provider agent listening on Render right now."
"It's handling discovery, inference, and payment settlement entirely via code. No humans involved."

----------------------------------------------------------------

3:15 — ACT 6: AI-POWERED BUILD (20s)

VISUAL:
- Quickly scroll through your ailogs/ folder in VS Code.
- Open 02-smart-contracts.md and scroll through the design reasoning.

AUDIO:
"And the best part? This entire project — contracts, agents, frontend — was built with AI-assisted development."
"From ideation to deployment, every architectural decision is documented in our AI Build Logs."

----------------------------------------------------------------

3:35 — OUTRO (15s)

VISUAL:
- Back to Dashboard.
- Pop up the "Connect Wallet" modal one last time to show the address.
- Fade to black with GitHub Repo URL and Live Demo URL.

AUDIO:
"ClawCompute is live on BSC Testnet. The autonomous agent economy is here. You can try it right now at the link below."
"Thanks for watching."

PRODUCTION TIPS

1. Resolution: Record in 1080p (1920x1080).
2. Clean Browser: Hide your bookmarks bar and extensions. Use a fresh Chrome profile or Incognito window.
3. Pre-Fund: Ensure your wallet has enough tBNB so you don't get "insufficient funds" errors.
4. Zoom: Zoom in on the browser (110% or 125%) so text is readable on mobile screens.
5. Audio: Record audio AFTER capturing video. It's much easier to time your voice to the video than vice-versa.
