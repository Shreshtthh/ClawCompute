# 🤖 AI Development Logs

This directory contains session logs from the development of ClawCompute.

AI-assisted pair programming was used throughout the project to accelerate design decisions, contract development, and agent implementation — with human review and iteration at every step.

## Development Approach

- **AI-accelerated** — used AI pair programming to speed up implementation
- **Human-reviewed** — all design decisions and contract logic reviewed manually
- **Iterative** — contracts, agents, and config evolved through real-time testing
- **On-chain validated** — all changes verified against live BSC Testnet transactions
